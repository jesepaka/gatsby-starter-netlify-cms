Every year, the security team at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport handles millions of passengers. But they were surprised to find a stray kitten roaming all by itself on the terminal ramp. Mama cat and kitten siblings were nowhere to be seen on that busy night. The airport’s public safety agents did the right thing in a dangerous situation.

Operation team members of the airport rushed to save the kitten after it was taken out of harm’s way. The kitten was cleaned, fed, and watered overnight. In spite of being scared, the kitten seemed to know that he was in good hands. It’s impossible to blame the security officers for being overly attentive to their unexpected visitor. Look at her pretty face!

 

When the incident was reported, and inquiries were made, there were still no answers to the kitten’s whereabouts. We didn’t know of any stray cats in the neighborhood, and no missing kittens were reported. It was undoubtedly a stray that somehow wandered far away and snuck past airport security, and the most likely scenario is that it was a stray that somehow snuck away.

On the day after Wes England rescued the little boy, he fell in love with him. The dad of two decided to adopt the stray dog knowing his family would feel the same way. Bo, short for Boeing, is the little guy’s nickname. Like the plane, his family named him Boeing.

 

England says Bo and his two kids have already become inseparable since they found a family a few days ago. Normally, a kitten would not be allowed on a ramp at an airport terminal, but Bo was in the right place at the right time.
